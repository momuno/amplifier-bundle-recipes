# Amplifier Recipes Bundle

**Multi-step AI agent orchestration for repeatable workflows**

The Recipes Bundle provides a tool and agents for creating, executing, and managing multi-step AI agent workflows. Define once, run anywhere, resume anytime.

## What Are Recipes?

**Recipes** are declarative YAML specifications that define multi-step agent workflows with:

- **Sequential execution** - Steps run in order, each building on the previous
- **Agent delegation** - Each step spawns a sub-agent with specific capabilities
- **State persistence** - Sessions automatically checkpoint for resumability
- **Context accumulation** - Later steps access earlier results via `{{variable}}` syntax
- **Approval gates** - Pause for human review with `requires_approval: true`
- **Foreach loops** - Iterate over collections with parallel execution support

**Use cases:**

- Code review workflows (analyze → identify issues → suggest fixes)
- Dependency upgrades (audit → plan → validate → apply)
- Test generation (analyze code → generate tests → validate coverage)
- Documentation evolution (analyze → simulate learner → improve)
- Research synthesis (extract → compare → synthesize → validate)

## Components

This bundle provides:

1. **tool-recipes** - Tool module for executing recipes
2. **recipe-author** - Agent for conversational recipe creation
3. **result-validator** - Agent for objective pass/fail validation
4. **Complete documentation** - Schema, guide, best practices, troubleshooting
5. **Examples** - 11 working recipes across domains
6. **Templates** - Starter recipes for common patterns

## Installation

### Using the Bundle

Load the bundle directly with Amplifier:

```bash
# Load from local path
amplifier --bundle ./bundle.md

# Load from git URL
amplifier --bundle git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes@main
```

### Including in Another Bundle

Add to your bundle's `includes:` section:

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: foundation
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes@main
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Validate a recipe to confirm the tool is available
amplifier --bundle ./bundle.md run "validate recipe examples/simple-analysis-recipe.yaml"
```

## Quick Start

### Execute a Recipe

```bash
amplifier --bundle ./bundle.md run "execute examples/code-review-recipe.yaml with file_path=src/auth.py"
```

### Create a Recipe

Use the recipe-author agent conversationally:

```bash
amplifier --bundle ./bundle.md run "I need to create a recipe for upgrading Python dependencies"
```

The agent guides you through:

1. Understanding your workflow
2. Defining steps and agent capabilities
3. Generating the YAML specification
4. Validating and saving the recipe

### Recipe Example

```yaml
name: "code-review-flow"
description: "Multi-stage code review with analysis, feedback, and validation"
version: "1.0.0"

context:
  file_path: ""  # Required input

steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    agent: "zen-architect"
    mode: "ANALYZE"
    prompt: "Analyze the code at {{file_path}} for complexity and maintainability"
    output: "analysis"

  - id: "suggest-improvements"
    agent: "zen-architect"
    mode: "ARCHITECT"
    prompt: "Based on this analysis: {{analysis}}, suggest concrete improvements"
    output: "improvements"

  - id: "validate-suggestions"
    agent: "zen-architect"
    mode: "REVIEW"
    prompt: "Review these suggestions: {{improvements}} for feasibility"
    output: "validation"
```

## Session Management

### Persistence

Recipe sessions persist to:

```
~/.amplifier/projects/<project>/recipe-sessions/
  recipe_20251118_143022_a3f2/
    state.json        # Current state and step outputs
    recipe.yaml       # The recipe being executed
```

### Resumability

If execution is interrupted, resume from last checkpoint:

```bash
amplifier run "resume recipe session recipe_20251118_143022_a3f2"
```

### Auto-Cleanup

Sessions older than 7 days are automatically cleaned up (configurable via tool config).

## Documentation

- **[Recipe Schema Reference](docs/RECIPE_SCHEMA.md)** - Complete YAML specification
- **[Recipes Guide](docs/RECIPES_GUIDE.md)** - Concepts and patterns
- **[Best Practices](docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md)** - Design guidelines
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Common issues and solutions
- **[Examples Catalog](docs/EXAMPLES_CATALOG.md)** - Browse all example recipes

## Examples

The `examples/` directory includes working recipes for:

- **Code Review** - Multi-stage analysis and improvement suggestions
- **Dependency Upgrade** - Audit, plan, validate, and apply (with optional approval gates)
- **Test Generation** - Analyze code and generate comprehensive tests
- **Security Audit** - Multi-perspective security analysis
- **Parallel Analysis** - Concurrent multi-file processing

See [Examples Catalog](docs/EXAMPLES_CATALOG.md) for complete descriptions.

## Templates

The `templates/` directory provides starter recipes:

- **simple-recipe.yaml** - Basic sequential workflow
- **multi-step-recipe.yaml** - Complex multi-stage processing
- **error-handling-recipe.yaml** - Retry and error handling patterns

Copy, customize, and run.

## Advanced Features

### Context Variables

Steps access previous outputs via template variables:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "analyze"
    prompt: "Analyze {{file_path}}"
    output: "analysis"

  - id: "improve"
    prompt: "Given this analysis: {{analysis}}, suggest improvements"
    output: "improvements"
```

### Approval Gates

Pause for human review:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: "plan-changes"
    agent: "zen-architect"
    prompt: "Plan dependency upgrades"
    output: "upgrade_plan"
    requires_approval: true  # Pauses here for human review
    approval_message: "Review the upgrade plan before applying"

  - id: "apply-changes"
    agent: "modular-builder"
    prompt: "Apply these upgrades: {{upgrade_plan}}"
```

### Parallel foreach

Run iterations concurrently:

```yaml
context:
  perspectives: ["security", "performance", "maintainability"]

steps:
  - id: "multi-analysis"
    foreach: "{{perspectives}}"
    as: "perspective"
    parallel: true
    collect: "analyses"
    agent: "zen-architect"
    prompt: "Analyze from {{perspective}} perspective"
```

## Tool Configuration

Configure via bundle config:

```yaml
tools:
  - module: tool-recipes
    source: ./modules/tool-recipes
    config:
      session_dir: ~/.amplifier/projects/{project}/recipe-sessions
      auto_cleanup_days: 7
      checkpoint_frequency: per_step
```

## Philosophy

Recipes follow Amplifier's core principles:

- **Mechanism, not policy** - Tool executes recipes; recipes define policy
- **Composable** - Steps are independent, reusable across recipes
- **Observable** - Full event logging of execution
- **Resumable** - Checkpointing enables recovery from failures
- **Declarative** - YAML specification separates intent from execution

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Recipe session not found"**

- Session may have been auto-cleaned (>7 days old)
- Check session dir: `~/.amplifier/projects/<slug>/recipe-sessions/`
- List active sessions: `amplifier run "list recipe sessions"`

**Issue: "Agent not found: agent-name"**

- Ensure the bundle includes foundation or defines the required agents
- List available agents in your session

**Issue: "Step failed: connection timeout"**

- Recipe resumes from last checkpoint
- Re-run: `amplifier run "resume recipe session <session-id>"`

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for complete solutions.
