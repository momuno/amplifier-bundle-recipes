## Recipe Structure

Recipes define multi-step workflows:

```yaml
name: "workflow-name"
description: "What this workflow accomplishes"
version: "1.0.0"

context:
  input_var: "" # Required inputs from user

steps:
  - id: "step-1"
    agent: "agent-name"
    mode: "ANALYZE"
    prompt: "Task description using {{input_var}}"
    output: "step_result"
    timeout: 300

  - id: "step-2"
    agent: "another-agent"
    prompt: "Continue with {{step_result}}"
    output: "final_result"
```
